Consider a system which consists of three subsystems, namely, A, B, and C. The FSM representing the behavior of subsystem A consists of 6 states, the FSM representing the behavior of subsystem B consists of 7 states, and the FSM representing the behavior of subsystem C consists of 8 states. The number of states in the FSM of the system obtained from the composition of the FSMs of subsystems A, B and C is:
- 336

A transition function in a FSM maps a _________ and a present  ____________ to next _____________:
- input, state, state

FSMs can be:
- Suited for systems with a finite number of states
- Used to model control aspects of a system
